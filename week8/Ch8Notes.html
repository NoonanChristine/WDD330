    <h1>Transforms</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page</li>
        <li>Can manipulate an element’s appearance usingtransform functions</li>
        <li>The order of transform functions does matter</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Translation</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down</li>
        <li>Similar to position: relative;</li>
        <li>Translated element can only be moved relative to its current position</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Scaling</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically</li>
        <li>When one value is provided will be used for both the x and y values</li>
        <li>Scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its center</li>
        <li>Scaling, like translation, has no impact on the document flow</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Rotation</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.</li>
        <li>Angles are declared in degrees</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Skew</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Specifies a skew along the x and y axes</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Changing the Origin of the Transform</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>transform-origin property controls the origin from which transforms are applied.</li>
        <li>Browser support for the transform-origin property is the same as for transform</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Transitions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time</li>
        <li>Declared along with the regular styles on an element</li>
        <li>Transition is declared in the default or originating state</li>
        <li>transition-property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned</li>
        <li>Must include a pre-state and a post-state.</li>
        <li>Exception to this “if there is a valid midpoint, it can be transitioned” rule is visibility</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>The transition-duration Property</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Sets how long the transition will take</li>
        <li>200ms is generally considered the optimum time for a transition</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>The transition-timing-function Property</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.</li>
        <li>Most common timing functions include the key terms ease , linear , ease-in , ease-out , or ease-in-out</li>
        <li>Can also describe timing function more precisely by defining own cubic-bezier function</li>
        <li>Can divide the transition over equidistant steps</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>The transition-delay Property</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins</li>
        <li>A negative time delay that’s less than the duration of the entire transition will cause it to start immediately</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>The transition Shorthand Property</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Shorthand for the four transition properties</li>
        <li>can be in any order</li>
        <li>if a delay is included must also include a duration and duration must precede the delay</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Multiple Transitions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>allow for multiple transitions in one call</li>
        <li>If want to change both properties at the same rate and delay can include both property names</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Animations</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes</li>
        <li>allow you to add any number of keyframes</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Keyframes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>To create animation, the @keyframes rule for IE10+ and FF16+. Include @-webkit-keyframes for all WebKit implementations followed by a choice of name, which is the identifier for the animation. Then, can specify keyframes</li>
        <li>Instead of a traditional selector you use a percentage value, or a comma-separated list of percentage values</li>
        <li>two keyterms― from and to ―which evaluate to 0% and 100% respectively</li>
        <li>Inside each keyframe include the properties you want to animate along with animated values</li>
        <li>An element must have at minimum an animation name for there to be an animation, and must also have a duration declared for the animation to be perceptible</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Animation Properties</h1>
    <ul></ul>
