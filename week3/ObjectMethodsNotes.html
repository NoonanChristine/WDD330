        <h3>Exercises from the article "Object Methods: this"</h3>
        
        <h4>Objects</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Objects represent real world entities</li>
            <li>Actions are represented by JavaScript functions</li>
            <li>Function that is a property of an object is called its method</li>
            <li>Called object-oriented programming</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Method Shorthand</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Use "this" to access an object</li>
            <li>Value of "this" is the object before the "." in calling the method</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>"This" is not bound</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Can be used in any function even if it's not a method of an object</li>
            <li>Does not depend on where the method was declared</li>
            <li>Function can be reused for different objects</li>
            <li>More possibilities of mistakes</li>
            <li>Value of "this" is defined at run-time</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Arrow Functions have no "this"</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>if "this" is referenced, it's taken from the outer normal function</li>
        </ul>
