    <h1>HTML5 APIs</h1>
    <h2>HTML5</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The HTML5 specification is separated into modules that allow different features to be developed at different paces then implemented without having to wait for other features to be completed</li>
        <li>when a previously unforeseen development occurs, a new module can be created to cater for it</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The data- Attribute</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser</li>
        <li>private to a page</li>
        <li>not intended to be used by an external service</li>
        <li>sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program</li>
        <li>provide a convenient way of adding data directly into the HTML markup, enabling a richer user experience</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card</li>
        <li>best practice to use feature detection before using any of the API methods</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>HTML5 Web Storage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is easier to use</li>
        <li>Different from cookies</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Information stored isnotshared with the server on every request</li>
            <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (if the domain is the same)</li>
            <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookie</li>
            <li>data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Geolocation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device</li>
        <li>info can be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of travel</li>
        <li>permission must be given first by user</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Web Workers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript</li>
        <li>Uses the Worker() constructor function</li>
        <li>Web workers use the concept of messages to communicate back and forth between the main script and worker script</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Shared Web Workers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>can create shared web workers that allow lots of different scripts on the same domain to access the same worker object</li>
        <li>allow computationally complex operations to be performed in a separate thread</li>
        <li>an application will not freeze or hang</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Service Workers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able to intercept network requests</li>
        <li>allows you to take alternative action if the network is offline</li>
        <li>require a secure network to run on HTTPS to avoid any malicious code hijacking network requests</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Websockets</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging</li>
        <li>a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received</li>
        <li>The close event occurs when the connection is closed. Done using the close() method</li>
        <li>Error event is fired when any sort of error occurs with the connection.</li>
        <li>information about the error can be accessed in the data property of the event object</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications</li>
        <li>usually a popup in the corner of the screen</li>
        <li>will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn't the current tab.</li>
        <li>Depending on browser and operating system, some notifications close automatically after short period of time and some stay on the screen until user clicks on them</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Multimedia</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML5 introduced the audio and video tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page</li>
        <li>introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript</li>
        <li>audio and video elements bring native support for multimedia into the browser</li>
        <li>API gives developers full control of the playback of audio tracks and video clips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other APIs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>comprehensive list of HTML5 APIs can be found at theMozilla Developer Network</li>
        <li>security and privacy considerations to keep in mind when considering some HTML5 APIs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Drawing shapes with canvas</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript</li>
        <li>A canvas element is a rectangular element on the web page</li>
        <li>can now be accessed in a JavaScript program using the document.getElementById() method</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Shims and Polyfills</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>can’t always guarantee that users will have the most up-to-date browser</li>
        <li>libraries of code that allow you to use the APIs as usual. T fill in the necessary code not provided natively by the user’s browser</li>
        <li>terms shim and polyfill are often used interchangeably</li>
        <li>shim is a piece of code that adds some missing functionality to a browser</li>
        <li>polyfill is a shim that achieves the same functionality while also using the API commands that would be used if feature was supported natively</li>
        <li>don’t need to write additional code to deal with different levels of support</li>
        <li>once users update their browsers you can remove the polyfill code without having to update any actual JavaScript code</li>
    </ul>
