    <h1>The Window Object</h1>
    <h2>The Browser Object Model</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>BOM for short - a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen</li>
        <li>creates pop-up windows</li>
        <li>only makes sense in a browser environment.</li>
        <li>can also refer to it using the keyword this in the global scope</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Going Global</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program</li>
        <li>properties of a global object</li>
        <li>in a browser environment the global object is the window object</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dialogs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>there are three functions that produced dialogs in the browsers: alert() , confirm() and prompt()</li>
        <li>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box</li>
        <li>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument and gives the options of OK or Cancel</li>
        <li>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program</li>
        <li>most browsers allow users to disable any dialogs from repeatedly appearing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Finding out browser information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object</li>
        <li>The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Location, Location, Location</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page</li>
        <li>This property is a read/write property, which means it can also be changed by assignment</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Browser History</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session</li>
        <li>The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page</li>
        <li>The window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods  can be used to navigate forwards and backwards by one page</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Controlling Windows</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A new window can be opened using the window.open() method</li>
        <li>can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later in the code</li>
        <li>The close() method can be used to close a window</li>
        <li>Also possible to move a window using the window.moveTo() method</li>
        <li>Can resize a window using the window.resizeTo() method</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Screen Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on</li>
        <li>The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the screen</li>
        <li>The colorDepth property can be used to find the color bit depth of the user’s monitor</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Document Object</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Each window object contains a document object</li>
        <li>This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>document.write()</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The write() method writes a string of text to the page</li>
        <li>Use of document.write() is heavily frowned upon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer.</li>
        <li>invented by Netscape as a way of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol</li>
        <li>can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user choices, authentication and tracking users</li>
        <li>take the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value pairs separated by semicolons</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Creating Cookies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To create a cookie assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar” using the document.cookie property</li>
        <li>The document.cookie property acts like a special type of string</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Changing Cookie Values</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Value can be changed by reassigning it to document.cookie using the same name but a different value</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reading Cookies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To see the current contents of the cookie jar enter document.cookie</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cookie Expiry Dates</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cookies are session cookies by default</li>
        <li>deleted once a browser session is finished</li>
        <li>can be made persistent</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Path and Domain of Cookies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>By default cookies can only be read by pages inside the same directory and domain as the file was set</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Secure Cookies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding the string ; secure to the end of a cookie ensures it’s only transmitted over a secure HTTPS network</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deleting Cookies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>set it to expire at a time in the past</li>
        <li>If it's a session cookie it will expire when the tab or window is closed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Timing Functions</h2>
    <h3>setTimeout()</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>setInterval()</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>works similarly to window.setTimeout() except it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Animation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>requestAnimationFrame()</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>works similarly to window.setInterval()</li>
        <li>makes the most of the browser’s built-in graphics-handling capabilities</li>
        <li> does not run the animation when the tab is inactive</li>
    </ul>
