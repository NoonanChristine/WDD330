<body>
    <h1>Client-side form validation</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format</li>
        <li>to ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls</li>
        <li>it is an initial check</li>
        <li>by catching invalid data on the client-side the user can fix it right away</li>
        <li>should not be considered an exhaustive security measure</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is form validation?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>form that provides feedback when you don't enter your data in the format it is expecting</li>
        <li>Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation</li>
        <li>validation done on the server is called server-side validation</li>
        <li>Three reasons to validate forms</li>
        <ul>
            <li>We want to get the right data, in the right format</li>
            <li>We want to protect our users' data</li>
            <li>We want to protect ourselves</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Different types of client-side validation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features</li>
        <li>JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Using built-in form validation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the most significant features of HTML5 form controls is the ability to validate most user data without relying on JavaScript</li>
        <li>done by using validation attributes on form elements</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Validating forms using JavaScript</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>must use JavaScript if want to take control or to deal with legacy browsers that do not support HTML's built-in form validation</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Constraint Validation API</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>consists of a set of methods and properties available on the form element DOM interfaces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Validating forms without a built-in API</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To validate, ask yourself a few questions:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>What kind of validation should I perform?</li>
            <li>What should I do if the form doesn't validate?</li>
            <li>How can I help the user to correct invalid data?</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
